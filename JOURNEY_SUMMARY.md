## üîç Key Insights & Learnings

### What Worked ‚úÖ

1. **Ensemble Methods (Hard Voting)**
   - Majority vote achieved 81.88% (best result)
   - Hard voting > soft voting by +2.17pp
   - Combining diverse models is key

2. **Model Diversity**
   - Different algorithms (RF, XGBoost)
   - Different feature sets (31, 46 features)
   - Complementary errors ‚Üí better ensemble

3. **Original Features**
   - 31 original features consistently best
   - Feature engineering hurt individual models
   - But helped ensemble diversity

4. **Systematic Approach**
   - Model zoo identified best models
   - Feature configs tested exhaustively
   - Ensemble methods explored thoroughly

5. **Conservative CV**
   - 10-fold CV provided reliable estimates
   - Helped avoid overfitting
   - Though underestimated ensemble performance

### What Didn't Work ‚ùå

1. **Feature Engineering (for single models)**
   - Interactions: -0.62pp
   - Polynomials: -0.46pp
   - All engineered: Even worse
   - **But:** Helped ensemble diversity

2. **Soft Voting**
   - Performed worse than hard voting (-2.17pp)
   - Overconfident probabilities may have biased results
   - Averaged probabilities smoothed out valuable disagreements

3. **Extensive Single Model Tuning**
   - GridSearchCV (80.50% CV) likely won't beat ensemble
   - Diminishing returns beyond 30 iterations
   - Ensemble diversity > single model perfection

### Critical Insights üí°

1. **Hard Voting is Underrated**
   - Often overlooked in favor of soft voting
   - More robust to overconfident predictions
   - Better for diverse model combinations
   - **Key to our success**

2. **Ensemble Diversity > Model Perfection**
   - Don't just tune one model extensively
   - Combine different models with different features
   - Complementary errors are valuable

3. **CV-Kaggle Gap is Unpredictable**
   - Usually negative (CV > Kaggle)
   - But can be positive for ensembles (+2.38pp for majority vote)
   - Don't rely solely on CV estimates

4. **Simpler is Often Better**
   - Original features > engineered features
   - Hard voting > soft voting
   - Occam's Razor applies

## üéì Technical Details

### Best Model Configuration

**Majority Vote Ensemble:**
- **Model 1:** Random Forest (31 features, 500 trees, max_depth=10)
- **Model 2:** Random Forest (46 features, 200 trees, max_depth=None)
- **Model 3:** XGBoost (31 features, 136 trees, max_depth=8)
- **Voting:** Hard voting (majority rule)
- **Result:** 81.88% Kaggle accuracy

### Why Majority Vote Won

1. **Robustness to Overconfidence**
   - Hard voting ignores probability scores
   - Each model gets equal vote
   - Prevents overconfident models from dominating

2. **Model Complementarity**
   - RF_Original: Strong on original features
   - RF_Poly: Captures polynomial relationships
   - XGBoost: Different algorithm, different patterns
   - Disagreements are valuable

3. **Decision Boundary Alignment**
   - Hard voting uses 0.5 threshold for each model
   - Better aligned with test set distribution
   - Soft voting's averaged probabilities may shift threshold

4. **Generalization**
   - Discrete decisions prevent probability artifacts
   - Reduces overfitting
   - More robust to test set variations
